Added "alarm-mega" to Make.tests, Rubric.alarm (probably not required, but just in case), and 	tests.c (to map "test_alarm_mega" to the right string)

Added "test_alarm_mega" to alarm-wait.c as a function to call test_sleep with 70 alarms.
	Also added it to tests.h to properly declare the above function
